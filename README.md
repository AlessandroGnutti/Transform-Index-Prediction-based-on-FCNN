# Transform-Index-Prediction-based-on-FCNN

## Overview

## Organization

In [**Matlab_code**](https://github.com/AlessandroGnutti/Transform-index-Prediction-based-on-FCNN/tree/main/Matlab_code) you can find the code for generating the [**Dataset**](https://github.com/AlessandroGnutti/Transform-index-Prediction-based-on-FCNN/tree/main/Dataset), which is composed by the quantized transform coefficients blocks, the graph index and the prediction mode labels.

In [**Results**](https://github.com/AlessandroGnutti/Transform-Index-Prediction-based-on-FCNN/tree/main/Results) you can find the confusion matrices and the top-k accuracies for each dataset (with and without prediction mode for residuals).

In [**Models**](https://github.com/AlessandroGnutti/Transform-Index-Prediction-based-on-FCNN/tree/main/Models) you can find the trained models for each dataset (with and without prediction mode for residuals).

In [**Architectures_figures**](https://github.com/AlessandroGnutti/Transform-Index-Prediction-based-on-FCNN/tree/main/Architectures_figures) you can find the illustration of the model architectures for each dataset.
