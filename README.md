## Overview

## Organization

In [**Matlab code**](https://github.com/AlessandroGnutti/Transform-index-Prediction-based-on-FCNN/tree/main/Matlab code) you can find .

In [**Results**](https://github.com/AlessandroGnutti/Transform-Index-Prediction-based-on-FCNN/tree/main/Results) you can find the confusion matrices and the top-k accuracies for each dataset (with and without prediction mode for residuals).

In [**Models**](https://github.com/AlessandroGnutti/Transform-Index-Prediction-based-on-FCNN/tree/main/Models) you can find the trained models for each dataset (with and without prediction mode for residuals).

In [**Architectures (figures)**](https://github.com/AlessandroGnutti/Transform-Index-Prediction-based-on-FCNN/tree/main/Architectures (figures)) you can find the illustration of the model architectures for each dataset.
